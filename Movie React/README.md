This program is a React application that fetches movie data from The Movie Database (TMDb) API and displays it in a user interface. It allows users to search for movies, displays trending movies by default, and presents movie posters, titles, ratings, and overviews in a visually appealing layout. The program also includes CSS styling for layout, colors, and hover effects, and it has a test case to ensure the main component renders without errors.
