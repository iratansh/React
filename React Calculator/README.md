This program is a simple calculator application built using React. It utilizes React hooks, specifically `useReducer`, to manage state changes based on user actions. The main functionalities include adding digits to form numbers, selecting arithmetic operations, clearing the calculator's state, deleting digits, and evaluating expressions.

Here's a summary of the main components and functionalities:

1. **Reducer Function (`reducer`):** Manages state transitions based on dispatched actions. It handles adding digits, choosing operations, clearing, deleting digits, and evaluating expressions.

2. **Evaluate Function (`evaluate`):** Performs arithmetic operations based on the selected operation.

3. **Formatting Functions (`formatOperand`):** Formats operands for display, ensuring numbers are presented in a readable format.

4. **App Component (`App`):** Renders the calculator interface. It displays the current and previous operands along with the selected operation. Users can interact with the calculator by clicking buttons to input digits, select operations, clear, delete digits, and evaluate expressions.

5. **Button Components (`DigitButton`, `OperationButton`):** Render buttons for digits and operations respectively. They dispatch actions to the reducer based on user interactions.

6. **Styling (`styles.css`):** Provides basic styling for the calculator interface using CSS Grid and simple colors.

Overall, this program implements a basic calculator functionality using React and demonstrates state management with `useReducer` hook, showcasing how to handle user inputs and perform calculations within a React application.
